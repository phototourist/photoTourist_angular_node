##Introduction
##Technical notes
The whole project has been structured based on **John Papa's style guide**. This project is created with differents types of code languages and frameworks. 
###John Papa's Style Guide
For the first time we have structured our project with the [John Papa's Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1). It's an interesting way of working in AngularJs. We recommend you to learn more about *John Papa*.

###Server
We used in the Server the framework **[node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**. Is a server-side, event-based Javascript environment. Actually it's a programming language very fashionable for its speed.

###Client
In the client part, we have decided to use **[AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/)**. This languague is a good framework Because it performs different tasks simply. It can generate views, use of data binding, routes, organization of components in modules, communication with the server ...

The project has also used **html**, **css** and **sass-css**.

###Deploy project automatically
Everytime we do a push to master branch on github DEMO: gets updated with latest changes. We have created an app on heroku and We've linked to our gitthub repository.

##Implement Free Certificate with Let's Encrypt
We have implemented the free security certificate for our project. The Let's Encrypt service offers the possibility to do it simply. 

###What is Let's Encrypt?
*[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)* is a free, automated and open certification authority (CA), which is run for the benefit of the public by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG). This makes it possible to obtain browser trust certificates for your free domains that are renewed automatically every 90 days.
