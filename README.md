##Introduction
##Technical notes
The whole project has been structured based on **John Papa's style guide**. This project is created with differents types of code languages and frameworks. 
###John Papa's Style Guide
For the first time we have structured our project with the [John Papa's Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1). It's an interesting way of working in AngularJs. We recommend you to learn more about *John Papa*.

###Server
We used in the Server the framework **[node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**. Is a server-side, event-based Javascript environment. Actually it's a programming language very fashionable for its speed.

###Client
In the client part, we have decided to use **[AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/)**. This languague is a good framework Because it performs different tasks simply. It can generate views, use of data binding, routes, organization of components in modules, communication with the server ...
